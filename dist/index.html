            <h1> Wecome to J's Portfolio!</h1>
            <p>For nine years, I worked as a dietitian, but am now a web-developer. Currently, I develop front end web.
               My team and I are  very interested in food and health, so we are working with people who want a website displaying their culinary abilities and plan to incorperate food delivery as a feature on their site.
              
              At the moment, we are developing two websites and working to learn more about photoshot and illustration in order to further our capabilities in working with Fewd.
              
              I am knowledgeable in JavaScript and Jquery,  Html, and have a firm grasp of color theory, which greatly aids the development of the design-aspect of websites.
              
              If you want to use the app and web to promote your business, we offer free consulting.
              
              The key to growing your business into a big business with a small investment is advertising via the web and apps.
              
              Have your own website...
              A new world opens.

            <h2 class="aboutH2">Front End Web Design</h2>
                <p>Front-end web development is the practice of converting data to a graphical interface, through the use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, so that users can view and interact with that data.Tools used for front-end development
                  There are several tools and platforms (wordpress, magento etc..) available that can be used to develop the front end of a website, and understanding which tools are best fit for specific tasks marks the difference between developing a hacked site and a well designed, scalable site</p>
